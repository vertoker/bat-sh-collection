## bat-sh-collection
My `.bat`/`.sh` utils for programming/project building/other

All scripts tested on Windows and Linux, works well

Use in any case you wanted

- `cmake-building` - call cmake build process
- `compile-shaders` - compile current shaders (not have test environment)
- `copy-resources` - replace `resource/` folder in build locations
- `run-file` - compile and run single code file (by default `g++`/`C++`)
- `single-file-compile` - detailed version of `run-file`, where you can specify what you want to build

(write `bat` script is a nightmare, I'd rather use `sh`, but it's Windows)
